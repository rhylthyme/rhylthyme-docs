These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Rhylthyme website, web application, and iOS application (collectively, the "Service") operated by Rhylthyme ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

## Acceptance of Terms

By creating an account or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our [Privacy Policy](privacy.md). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Service.

We reserve the right to update these Terms at any time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated Terms on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the Service after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

## Description of Service

Rhylthyme is a workflow scheduling tool that allows users to:

- Create, edit, and visualize real-time event schedules and workflows using a JSON-based program format.
- Execute programs through an interactive terminal interface or web-based visualization.
- Import workflows from external sources.
- Share programs publicly via share links.
- Use AI-powered chat to create and modify programs.
- Access the Service via the web application or iOS application.

The Service may be updated, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice.

## User Accounts

### Registration

To use certain features of the Service, you must create an account using one of our supported authentication methods (Google OAuth, Apple Sign-In, or email magic link).

### Account Responsibilities

You are responsible for:

- Maintaining the security of your account and authentication credentials.
- All activity that occurs under your account.
- Notifying us promptly of any unauthorized use of your account.

You must provide accurate and complete information when creating your account. You may not create an account on behalf of another person without their permission, and you may not create multiple accounts to circumvent restrictions or abuse the Service.

## User Content

### Ownership

You retain all ownership rights to the programs, workflows, and other content you create using the Service ("User Content"). We do not claim ownership of your User Content.

### License to Us

By using the Service, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide license to store, display, and process your User Content solely to provide and improve the Service. This license terminates when you delete your User Content or your account.

### Shared Content

When you share a program via a public share link, you grant other users a non-exclusive right to view, fork, and use that shared program. You may revoke sharing at any time by unsharing or deleting the program.

You are solely responsible for your User Content and any consequences of sharing it publicly. Do not share content that you do not have the right to distribute.

### Content Preservation

We perform regular backups but do not guarantee that your User Content will be preserved indefinitely. You are responsible for maintaining your own copies of important programs.

## AI-Generated Content

### How AI Features Work

The Service includes AI-powered features (such as the chat interface) that use the Anthropic Claude API to generate, modify, or suggest program content.

### Disclaimer

AI-generated content is provided "as-is" and may contain errors, inaccuracies, or unexpected results. You are responsible for reviewing and validating any AI-generated programs before relying on them. We make no warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, or fitness of AI-generated content for any particular purpose.

### Your Responsibility

You are solely responsible for any AI-generated content you choose to save, share, or execute. AI-generated content that you save to your account becomes your User Content and is subject to the same terms.

## Acceptable Use

You agree not to use the Service to:

- Violate any applicable law, regulation, or third-party rights.
- Upload or share content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable.
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service, other accounts, or related systems.
- Interfere with or disrupt the Service or its infrastructure.
- Use automated means (bots, scrapers, etc.) to access the Service without our prior written consent.
- Reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the Service.
- Use the Service to transmit malware, viruses, or other harmful code.
- Abuse the AI chat feature by attempting to circumvent its safety measures or using it for purposes unrelated to the Service.
- Impersonate any person or entity, or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity.
- Use the Service to send unsolicited communications or spam.

We reserve the right to investigate and take appropriate action against anyone who violates these provisions, including removing content and suspending or terminating accounts.

## Intellectual Property

### Our Intellectual Property

The Service, including its design, code, visual elements, documentation, and underlying technology, is owned by Rhylthyme and protected by intellectual property laws. These Terms do not grant you any rights to our trademarks, logos, or brand features.

### The Rhylthyme Program Format

The Rhylthyme JSON program format specification is made available for use in creating and sharing programs. Programs you create using this format belong to you as described in the User Content section.

### Feedback

If you provide us with feedback, suggestions, or ideas about the Service, you grant us a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use that feedback for any purpose without obligation to you.

## Third-Party Services

The Service integrates with third-party services including Supabase, Anthropic, Vercel, Google, and Apple. Your use of these third-party services is subject to their respective terms of service and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the practices or availability of third-party services.

## Fees and Payment

The Service is currently offered free of charge. We reserve the right to introduce paid features or subscription plans in the future. If we do, we will provide advance notice and clearly identify which features require payment.

## Limitation of Liability

**To the maximum extent permitted by law:**

- The Service is provided "as-is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
- We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure.
- We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of or inability to use the Service.
- Our total liability for any claims arising from these Terms or the Service shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the twelve months preceding the claim, or one hundred U.S. dollars ($100), whichever is greater.
- We are not responsible for any loss of data, programs, or User Content, regardless of cause.

Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties or liability. In such jurisdictions, our liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

## Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Rhylthyme and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from your use of the Service, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any third-party rights.

## Termination

### By You

You may stop using the Service at any time. You may request account deletion by contacting us at [legal@rhylthyme.com](mailto:legal@rhylthyme.com).

### By Us

We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with or without cause and with or without notice. Reasons for termination may include, but are not limited to, violation of these Terms or conduct that we determine is harmful to other users or to us.

### Effect of Termination

Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases immediately. We may delete your account data in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](privacy.md). Provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination will survive, including ownership, warranty disclaimers, indemnification, and limitations of liability.

## Dispute Resolution

Any disputes arising from these Terms or the Service will first be attempted to be resolved through good-faith negotiation. If negotiation fails, disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association, except that either party may seek injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction.

**Class Action Waiver:** You agree to resolve disputes with us on an individual basis and waive any right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.

## Governing Law

These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

## Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

## Entire Agreement

These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Rhylthyme regarding the Service and supersede any prior agreements or understandings.
